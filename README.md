🧠 AI Assistance

I used AI support (ChatGPT – GPT-5) for some parts of this project.
I primarily sought help for specific issues I couldn’t solve, such as:

CSS animation timing and transitions

JavaScript logic for the back-to-top button

OpenLayers map setup and coordinate configuration

Dropdown sparkle effects and hamburger placement

I received assistance only for the parts I couldn’t complete on my own.
The overall design, structure, and customization were implemented by me.

⏱️ AI Usage Duration

Approximately 3 hours of total AI-assisted troubleshooting and learning time.

💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

How to build a fully responsive static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

How to integrate OpenLayers for custom mapping

How to use GitHub Pages for publishing

The importance of animation timing and visual hierarchy in UI design
